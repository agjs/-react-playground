# React Playground

This simple repository is useful for testing React features and profiling. Since we are pulling
dependencies from CDN, there's no need for installing, bundling or configuring anything. Just clone
the repo and play with React.

The idea is to completely remove any side effects and focus purely on React and its ecosystem.

If you create new components or any JSX files in general, don't forget to include them under your
index.html scripts.

_This repository is not inteded for providing production ready tooling nor for builing projects in general. You should primarly use it as a playground to test out internal features, measure preformances and similar._

## What's included

- React 16
- ReactRedux
- ReactDOM
- Redux

Don't forget to add all the nasty React and Redux tools for your browser.
